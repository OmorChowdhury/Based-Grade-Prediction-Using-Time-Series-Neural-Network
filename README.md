# Based-Grade-Prediction-Using-Time-Series-Neural-Network
This project applies data science and deep learning techniques to real-world data in order to perform behavior-based prediction using a time series neural network. The main objective is to explore temporal patterns in data and use them to build predictive models using neural networks.
